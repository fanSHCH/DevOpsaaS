If Java Service need debug or test from remote, please uncomment the docker-compose.yml from
    image: app
    #ports:
    #  - "8080:8080"
to 
    image: app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
not Java Service can be access during the port 8080 in host ip. a new line could added under the port to add another expose port such as for debugging.
